# A script for BetterDiscord that let's the user customize the color for Usernames in DMs and Groups

## Info

This plugin aims to provide a solution for the problem of colorless private chats. You can adjust the colors so that your DMs look just like server chats without requiring the use of roles.


## How to Use

Download the file and put it into your plugins folder. Enable it and open the plugin settings by clicking the cogwheel. Now you will see the following window:


![Settings1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de47cbba-5f26-4540-bbc0-9f80c154a322)


Once you click "Add Username" you'll be given the option to add a user and pick a color on the right side:


![Settings2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de59b701-4940-429f-aa55-edcc60bfa261)


You have different options for picking your color. Either move the dot around in the color window, pick a color with the Color picker tool or enter numbers below the color window. Clicking on RGB let's you switch
between RGB, HSL and HEX. Once you're done click "Done". Now whenever you go to your DMs the username will have the color you chose.
